WARNING: This script and the output of it comes with all the usual caveats about potentially bricking your device and if you do it's your fault. You have been warned! I tested it on one game and it worked fine. YMMV.

Why PowerShell? No particular reason - it could have been in another. Indeed, feel free to convert it.
