# PS5-Convert-WiiVCSavegame2WiiUVCSavegame
**WARNING**: This script and the output of it comes with all the usual caveats about potentially bricking your device and if you do it's your fault. You have been warned! I tested it on one game and it worked fine. YMMV.

## Instructions
1. This was written in PowerShell 5.1. I have no idea if it works in lower versions.
2. Edit the script in the three places mentioned in the script itself.
3. Run it (no need to be a local admin - I'm not and it worked fine for me).

As it doesn't do any error checking, so anything wrong should throw an exception. If you get no errors, it has probably generated a good output file.
